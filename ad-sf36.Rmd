# SF36 scores

After excluding missing or incomplete SF36 surveys, 980 participants remained.



# top 5 ADs

ME/CFS participants were excluded, as it is unknown whether they were part of the Emerge cohort. This excluded 154 participants, and 1079 participants remained.
The 5 highest represented ADs were:

* Coeliac, 191 participants
* Hashimoto's, 147 participants
* Sjoegren's, 106 participants
* Rheumatoid arthritis, 105 participants
* Lupus (SLE), 62 participants

When looking at interconnectivity between participants and multiple instances of the top 5 ADs, it becomes clear that there is a large amount of cross over.

Next line in inquiry is looking into number of ADs and QoL through SF36 in general, as well as specifically for the top 5 ADs.

## Check further ADs

Top 5 ADs were chosen due to representative numbers. How do the next 3 most represented ADs fare? Are there enough representative samples to show statistically robust trends?

## comparison to ME cohort

We've seen that quite a few people have multiple ADs here. How does this compare to the ME cohort? It's uncertain whether we'd get a complete list of ADs from participants in the Solve and Emerge registries, so let's have a look at the Autoimmunity survey ME cohort.

![image](ad-sf36/upset-me.png)
Looking at the interconnectivity of ME with other ADs shows that around a third of respondents solely have ME, two thirds have ME in conjunction with between one and eleven other illnesses.

# Comparing QoL between disorders by different number of total disorders

Question: SLE and Sjogrens don't show any statistical significance here. Perhaps because numbers too low? Should they be excluded, and also should controls be included as comparison?
